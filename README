This was originally my final project for CMSC405, "Computer Graphics." It was a
class on OpenGL.

Building on Linux:

A Makefile is included. 

You need freeglut, SDL, SDL_mixer, and SDL_image, glew, and glm to build. On
Ubuntu, the packages required are libsdl-mixer1.2-dev, libsdl-image1.2-dev,
freeglut3-dev, libglew1.6-dev, libglm-dev.


Building on Windows:

You need libs and DLLs.

updated these to include GLEW and glm yet. They're easy to get off the web,
though.)
